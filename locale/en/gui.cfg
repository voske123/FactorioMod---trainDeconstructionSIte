;Introduction
introduction=Introduction
introduction-1=Dear player,
introduction-2=This mod introduces a more realistic way of building trains. The trains are created inside a building instead of being manually placed down. When the train is built, it will drive off to the depot stop, where you can manually send it away. You can access trains in the depot from the map view, meaning you don't have to be close by. Copying & pasting a schedule in one of these trains will immediatly let the train do its job.
introduction-3=Here you can find some basic information about the setup and workings of the construction site. The construction site is built around three entities:\n - [img=item/traindepot] the __ITEM__traindepot__,\n - [img=item/trainassembly] the __ITEM__trainassembly__,\n - [img=item/traincontroller] the __ITEM__trainassembly__ controller.
introduction-4=You can find more info about these entities in their menu by clicking the buttons on the left hand side.
introduction-5=If you find any bugs or if you have any questions, feel free to contact us on the mod portal or in the discussion section! You can also make a bug report on GitHub.
introduction-6=Kind regards and have fun playing!\nLovely_santa and Voske_123
introduction-7=Hide the help button in the top left corner.\nYou can always re-enable this in the player settings or by unchecking this box.

;Traindepot
traindepot-h1=Usability
traindepot-1=The depot is used to store freshly made trains. Of course you can also send other trains that are out of use to these stations.
traindepot-2=When you are in need of more trains, you can take them from the depot and put them to use. You can even do this from the mapview without needing to be close to the depot!
traindepot-h2=Depot statistics
traindepot-3=When you open the depot entity (__CONTROL__open-gui__), you can see some basic information about the depot.
traindepot-4=[font=default-semibold]Depot name:[/font] The name of this depot. By pressing the edit button or switching tabs, you can change the depot name to anything you want, similar to how you change the name of a train stop. Of course you can also use the copy/paste tool for renaming purposes.
traindepot-5=[font=default-semibold]Available depot spots:[/font] The amount of depot spots that are available. This is shown as "available/total" station count. Building more stations with the same name extends the total amount of trains that stay in the depot.
traindepot-h3=Depot configuration settings
traindepot-6=[font=default-semibold]Requested amount:[/font] In the depot menu, you can set the amount of trains you want to have in the depot. When the amount of trains that is present in the depot is lower than the requested amount, the connected builders will create more trains until the request is fullfilled.
traindepot-7=[font=default-semibold]Connected trainbuilders:[/font] The trainbuilders that are connected to this depot to fulfill the requests. This also shows a list of all the controllers which you can access from here.

;Trainbuilder
trainassembly-h1=Functionality
trainassembly-1=The __ITEM__trainassembly__ will assemble the trainparts to functional train wagons and locomotives. You put the ingredients inside the building like you do for an assembling machine. After that, it will start producing finished trains. However, without a traincontroller attached, it won't place the train on the track.
trainassembly-h2=Building requirements
trainassembly-2=[img=utility/warning_icon] You can't place trains everywhere, they must be placed on rails. This means the building must also be placed on (straight) rails. This way, the building will assemble the trains onto the tracks directly.
;trainassembly-3=[img=trainConstructionSite-help-content-icon1] Trains are 6 tiles wide, with one tile inbetween each train. The building is also 6 tiles wide, the same length of trains themself. In order to link multiple __ITEM__trainassembly__s together, the buildings must be spaced one tile apart.
; It seems you don't really mean trains in "Trains are 6 tiles wide", but train components (i.e. locomotives and wagons). A train is the combination of locomotive(s) and wagons(s), so I guess you can't place all the trainbuilders for two different trains on the same track. Here's my take:
trainassembly-3=[img=trainConstructionSite-help-content-icon1] Locomotives and wagons are 6 tiles wide each, with one tile between them. The building is also 6 tiles wide. In order to construct a complete train, you must link multiple __ITEM__trainassembly__s together by placing the buildings one tile apart from each other.
trainassembly-4=[img=utility/electricity_icon_unplugged] Assembling a train requires heavy duty tools, so you must provide some power to the buildings. They are quite power hungry, but they support [img=item/effectivity-module-3] __ITEM__effectivity-module__s to be put inside. Because of safety reasons, we cannot allow __ITEM__speed-module__s, and obviously, __ITEM__productivity-module__s make no sense at all.
trainassembly-h3=Recipe requirements
trainassembly-5=[img=utility/no_building_material_icon] Each train requires parts to be build. These parts can be made separately with the same ingredients as you would make a train without this mod present.
trainassembly-6=[img=trainConstructionSite-help-content-icon2] The train needs to be able to drive away, which means the locomotives require fuel. As we didn't want to limit your fuel options, we chose to make a generic fuel item [img=item/trainassembly-recipefuel] that can be made out of all other fueling items.
#~ Could you add train fuel made from Pellet coke if Bio Industries is installed? Can trains still use other fuel then this mod's Trainfuel?
trainassembly-7=[img=utility/not_enough_repair_packs_icon] The __ITEM__trainassembly__ has a blue arrow, showing the direction of the building. This is useful when building train wagons where the orientation matters (for example the __ENTITY__locomotive__ or __ENTITY__artillery-wagon__).
#~ I think it's better to use "wagons" instead of "carriages" because these things are called "wagons" in the vanilla game and the description of the picture uses "Cargo wagon facing â€¦"
trainassembly-8=In the picture above, the __ITEM__trainassembly__ will create a train (left to right) that is made of:\n - [img=entity/locomotive] __ENTITY__locomotive__ facing west\n - [img=entity/cargo-wagon] __ENTITY__cargo-wagon__ facing west (direction doesn't matter)\n - [img=entity/cargo-wagon] __ENTITY__cargo-wagon__ facing west\n - [img=entity/cargo-wagon] __ENTITY__cargo-wagon__ facing east\n - [img=entity/cargo-wagon] __ENTITY__cargo-wagon__ facing east\n - [img=entity/locomotive] __ENTITY__locomotive__ facing east

trainassembly-9=For those that like to express train configurations as numbers, this would be a 1-4-1 train (1 locomotive facing the front, 4 carriages, 1 locomotive facing the rear).

;Traincontroller
traincontroller-h1=Placement requirements
traincontroller-1=The controller must be placed in front of the __ITEM__trainassembly__s so it can control them. They are placed the same way as a __ENTITY__train-stop__:\n - On the right side of the track\n - In the direction the train will approach it (yellow arrows).
traincontroller-2=Because the train exits automatically, at least one locomotive must be facing this direction so the train can drive away. In order to make sure your train can go somewhere, we force you to place at least one __ITEM__traindepot__ on your map before you can place any controller.
traincontroller-h2=Controller statistics
traincontroller-3=When you open the controller entity (__CONTROL__open-gui__), you can see some basic information about the builder.
traincontroller-4=[font=default-semibold]Connected depot name:[/font] The name of the depot this controller is working for. By pressing the edit button or switching tabs, you can change the name to any depot that is currently present, similar to how you change the name of a train stop. Of course you can also use the copy/paste tool for renaming purposes.
traincontroller-5=[font=default-semibold]Depot request status:[/font] The amount of trains the depot is requesting. This is shown as "current/requested" occupation in the depot. If the current amount is lower than the requested amount, the controller will send a train to the depot. If you want to change the requested amount, you have to do that inside the depot.
traincontroller-6=[font=default-semibold]Builder status:[/font] The current status of this depot. This can be:\n - Constructing a train\n - Waiting for a request\n - Dispatching the train\nThe controller will start placing carriages on the tracks as soon as one is done building. When the train is traveling to the depot, the builder will instantly start creating a new train.
traincontroller-h3=Trainbuilder interface
traincontroller-7=The traincontroller also has some features for the trainbuilder configuration as shown in the image below.
traincontroller-8=Instead of having to go around and rotate your __ITEM__trainassembly__ entities manualy, you can do this inside the interface by pressing the [img=traincontroller-orientation-L]/[img=traincontroller-orientation-R] buttons to change the orientation. For __ENTITY__locomotive__s you can also choose the color in the color picker menu by pressing the [img=utility/color_picker] button.
